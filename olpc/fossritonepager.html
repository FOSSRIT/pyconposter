        <a target="_blank" href="http://foss.rit.edu">FOSS@RIT</a> is an applied research program run through the <a target="_blank" href="http://rit.edu">RIT</a> Lab for Technological Literacy. Our program focuses on Free/Opensource Software and Open Web Technology. As an applied research lab, our students, staff, and faculty write more code than white papers. We are developer-driven, code-centric, and we architect high-impact, low-cost campaigns.

        <h2>Engagement Strategies</h2>
        There are both traditional and non-traditional avenues for engagement
        with our lab and it's talent.

        <h3>Non-Traditional</h3>
        <ul>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Hackathons</b></dt>
            <dd>Hackathons are low-cost, low time commitment events, usually occurring over an 8-48 hour period. They can be focused sprints around particular bugs or features, open social coding events, or bounty/contest based format. They are sponsored by an upstream organization, typically held on-site at the <a target="_blank" href="http://innovation.rit.edu">RIT Center for Student Innovation</a>, and run about twice every 11 week academic quarter.</dd><br/>
            <dd> Example Hackathons:

            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://stemchallenge.org">National STEM Video Game Challenge Hackathon</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.rit.edu/innovationcenter/crisiscamproc-hack-thon-haiti-follow">CrisisCamp: Hackathon for Haiti</a></li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://blog.capitolcamp.org/">CapitolCamp: Developer Summit</a></li>
        </ul></dd><br/>

        <dt><b>Collaborative Innovation Teams</b></dt>
        <dd>Project teams need more than just coders. When you build a student team with both technical and non-technical majors, a more well-rounded product or initiative can be developed. By working with the Center for Student Innovation, these teams are a more informal arrangement than traditional sponsored research, and come with much less overhead and technology transfer costs. Sponsoring organizations are critical to the development path, and serve as mentors along with RIT Staff and Faculty.</dd>

    </ul>
        <h3>Traditional</h3>
        <ul>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Talent Scouting and Placement</b></dt>
            <dd>Most RIT Students are required to do at least two blocks of workstudy in order to receive their degree. Our program works with prospective employers and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rit.edu/emcs/oce/">RIT Office of Cooperative Education and Career Services</a> to recruit, interview, and eventually hire RIT students into Co-op and Internship programs.</dd><br/>
            <dd>Companies and organizations may also utilize these services to secure recent graduates for Part-time, Full-time, or contract employment.</dd><br/>
            <dt><b>Sponsored Research</b></dt>
            <dd>Our lab can help work through RIT <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rit.edu/research/">Sponsored Research Services</a> for traditional technology transfer arrangements.</dd><br/>
            <dt><b>Grant Proposal Development</b></dt>
            <dd>Principal Investigators work with partner organizations and the RIT <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rit.edu/development/giving/corporate/">offices of Development and Corporate Relations</a> to seek and secure grant funding.</dd><br/>
            <dd>Example Grant Program:</dd>
                <dd><a target="_blank" href="http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=48255">RIT/Knight Foundation: Rise Above the Crowd Campaign (site down for maintenance)</a></dd>
