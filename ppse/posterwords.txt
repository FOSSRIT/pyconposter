{T1} The RIT Remixerator (Title + brief blurb}
The RIT Remixerator[0] is an open source project that provides a web-based
interface to creating custom Fedora Remixes. This project was a fork of the
Dorrie project[1], which leverages Django[2], and several python libraries, to
create its user experience.


{SS1}
SCREEN SHOT OF HOME SCREEN
The user is prompted to supply general information about their remix, including
the name of the distribution, and a base kickstart[3] file. If the RIT
Remixerator's server has the spin-kickstarts package[4] installed, the user may
select one of the included kickstart files as the base for their remix. Using
Django forms, the user may also upload their own kickstart file to use. Users
are assigned a unique ID, allowing the Remixerator to support multiple sessions 
at once.


{SS2}
SCREEN SHOT OF PACKAGES
The pykickstart[5] library parses the base kickstart file and creates
appropriate objects that encapsulate many options--perhaps most importantly,
its package information. This information is easily iterable, and
the corresponding fields are chosen programmatically through the use of
Django's Mako Templates[6] extension. Some options, like those for the desktop
environment, have dynamically displayed preview images.


{SS3}
Processing Image?
After selecting packages, the RIT Remixerator uses pykickstart to transform the
corresponding state object into a new kickstart file, ready to be served to the
user.

The user may choose download their new modified kickstart file, or the
kickstart file can be supplied to other remix creation tools, such as the
livecd-creator tool[7], or distributed to special interest groups[8] so that
people can make their own.

{SS5}

Alternatively, the user can initiate one last step and turn the kickstart file
into a livecd. The RIT Remixerator launches a new process, handing the
kickstart file to the livecd-creator tool. The user is notified upon
completion, and may download their fresh disk image.



{T2}
What is a Fedora Spin/Remix?

{KS1}
Picture: Spin logo and Remix logo
Groups of users create Fedora installations for specific reasons such as
security tools or scientific applications. The Fedora community makes these
types of tailored distributions available, through officially endorsed flavors
(spins), or through unofficial configurations that may or may not use Fedora
software (remixes).

{KS2}
Picture: snippets of a kickstart file (%include portion, snippet of %packages)
Spins and Remixes are based on one of several configurations that range from a
minimal kickstart, to the KDE live cd kickstart file, or others (link to a
list of kickstarts). The remix or spin kickstart can then add to, or remove
from, the list of packages pulled into the temporary file system that is made
when using the livecd-creator tool.

{KS3}
Picture: snippets of a kickstart file (%post)
Kickstart files can be customized tailor the created livecd environment in the
post script section. This can range from setting the default wallpaper and
aesthetics of the install, to customizing the settings of various applications,
to even changing the livecd user's home environment.
