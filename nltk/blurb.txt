Twitter data is acquired through two means: the query API, and the data stream. Twitter allows public access to up to 1% of the overall datastream, and developer accounts can poll up to 350 requests every hour. A two-hour debate session resulted in hundreds of thousands of acquired tweets. Data is verified as correct JSON entries before the relevant parts are pulled out, formatted, and stored into a MongoDB database for later analysis.
